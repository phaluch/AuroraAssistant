For now, a personal project to help me organize my life a bit better

### 20250605
Done bringing preexisting infrastructure to this project, ready to implement new features.
Gonna try and add an orchestrator upstream from the 'backend agent', to later add other tooling.
This is definitely gonna prompt a readjustment in how agents are organized in the repo.
